        This class is in charge of communicating with Kimeme, being the file-based CLI or the interaction via sockets
        The general interface will be defined in conjunction with the kimeme-side modules, which are yet to be designed.
        This is a draft class at the moment, but it will be needed soon for the scheduler environment
